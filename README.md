## Project Overview

The **Weather Monitoring System** is a Python-based application that retrieves weather data from multiple cities, processes it, stores it in an SQLite database, and visualizes key metrics such as temperature and humidity. The system also includes an alerting mechanism to send email notifications when certain weather conditions (e.g., high temperature) are met.

It uses the OpenWeatherMap API and supports data visualization through `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries.

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieves real-time weather data (temperature, humidity) using OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Data Storage**: Stores weather data in an SQLite database for persistence.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends email notifications when predefined weather thresholds (e.g., temperature > 35Â°C) are exceeded.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates graphical representations of temperature and humidity trends over time.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests for key modules in the system.
